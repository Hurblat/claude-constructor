# Review Pull Request Command

## Purpose

Review pull request for the increment implemented to satisfy the issue.
$1 contains the issue key, $2 contains the path to the state management file.
This command is called by an orchestrating command, and is one of the steps in a larger workflow.
You MUST follow all workflow steps below, not skipping any step and doing all steps in order.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Load Settings**: Read the Settings section in the state management file ($2)

2. **Check Silent Mode**:
   - If `silent-mode` is `true`:
     - Log: "Silent mode: Skipping PR review monitoring and comments"
     - Skip to step 7
   - If `silent-mode` is `false`:
     - Continue with normal PR review workflow (steps 3-6)

3. Monitor the pull request for comments and/or reviews. Use `gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{PR_NUMBER}/comments --jq '.[] | {author: .user.login, body: .body, path: .path, line: .line}'`

4. For each unaddressed comment:
    - Implement the requested changes
    - Commit and push changes. Read @docs/git-commit.md for commit guidelines. Check that there are not unstaged changes you haven't considered.

5. Add a reply to each addressed comment explaining how the requested changes were addressed (or if it was a question, your response to the question): `gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/pulls/{PR_NUMBER}/comments --method POST --field body="Your message here" --field in_reply_to={COMMENT_ID_NUMBER}`
    - Do not edit existing comments
    - Reply to specific comments, do not make general PR comments

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 until the user approves the pull request. You are not allowed to approve the pull request yourself.

7. **Add pull request feedback comment** (only if silent mode and not prompt):
   - If `silent-mode` is `false` AND `issue-tracking-provider` is NOT `"prompt"`:
     - Use the SlashCommand tool to execute `/create-comment $1 "[user feedback summary and changes made in response]"`
   - If `silent-mode` is `true` OR `issue-tracking-provider` is `"prompt"`:
     - Log: "Silent mode: Would have added PR feedback comment to issue"
