# Create Issue Comment Command

## Purpose

Add a comment to an issue in the configured issue tracking system.
This command is called by other orchestrating commands, and is one of the steps in a larger workflow.
You MUST follow all workflow steps below, not skipping any step and doing all steps in order.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Load Settings**:
   !`$(command -v python3 || command -v python) ./scripts/load_settings.py`

2. **Check Silent Mode or Prompt Issue Provider**:
   - If `silent-mode` is `true` OR `issue-tracking-provider` is `"prompt"`:
     - Log the comment operation locally: "Silent mode: Would have added comment to $1: $2"
     - Skip the actual API call (step 3)
     - Continue to step 4

3. **Execute Create Comment Operation** (only if silent mode is false):

### For Linear Provider (`"linear"`)
- Use `linear:create_comment` with $1 (issue ID) and $2 (comment text)
- Add the comment to the specified issue

### For Jira Provider (`"jira"`)
- Use `jira:add_comment_to_issue` with $1 (issue key) and $2 (comment text)
- Add the comment to the specified issue

4. **Output Results**: Display confirmation of the comment creation:
   - **Issue**: $1
   - **Comment Added**: $2
   - **Result**: Success/Failure (or "Skipped - Silent Mode" if applicable)

5. **Error Handling**: If the issue operation fails, log the error but continue gracefully
