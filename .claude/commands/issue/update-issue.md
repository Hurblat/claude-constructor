# Update Issue Command

## Purpose

Update the status of an issue in the configured issue tracking system.
This command is called by other orchestrating commands, and is one of the steps in a larger workflow.
You MUST follow all workflow steps below, not skipping any step and doing all steps in order.

Expected status values: "In Progress", "Code Review"

## Workflow Steps

1. **Load Settings**:
   !`$(command -v python3 || command -v python) ./scripts/load_settings.py`

2. **Check Silent Mode or Prompt Issue Provider**:
   - If `silent-mode` is `true` OR `issue-tracking-provider` is `"prompt"`:
     - Log the status update operation locally: "Silent mode: Would have updated $1 status to '$2'"
     - Skip the actual API calls (step 3)
     - Continue to step 4

3. **Execute Update Status Operation** (only if silent mode is false):

### For Linear Provider (`"linear"`)
- First, use `linear:list_issue_statuses` to get all available statuses for $1
- Find the best match for $2 (handles typos/variations)
- Use `linear:update_issue` with $1 to set the issue to the matched status
- If no exact match is found, use the closest matching status name

### For Jira Provider (`"jira"`)
- First, use `jira:get_transitions_for_issue` with $1 to get all available columns
- Find the best match for $2 (handles typos/variations)
- Use `jira:transition_issue` with $1 to move the issue to the matched transition
- If no exact match is found, use the closest matching status name

4. **Output Results**: Display confirmation of the status update:
   - **Issue**: $1
   - **Previous Status**: [if available]
   - **New Status**: $2
   - **Result**: Success/Failure (or "Skipped - Silent Mode" if applicable)

5. **Error Handling**: If the issue operation fails, log the error but continue gracefully
