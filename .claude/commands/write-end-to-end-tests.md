# Write End-To-End Tests for Increment Command

## Purpose

Write end-to-end tests for the implemented increment using the specification linked in the state management file ($1).
This command is called by an orchestrating command, and is one of the steps in a larger workflow.
You MUST follow all workflow steps below, not skipping any step and doing all steps in order.

## Workflow Steps

1. Understand how the increment has been implemented, and the context surrounding it:
    - Read specification to learn the business value that the increment is delivering, and what the plan for implementing that value is
    - Read the code implemented, using git to identify what has been added

2. Write a plan for how to test the necessary behavior

3. Write end-to-end tests that cover your plan

4. Report DONE to the orchestrating command

## This part of the workflow is done when

- [ ] Frontend behavior is verified using end-to-end tests
- [ ] All unit, integration, and end-to-end tests pass (100% coverage of user behavior expected)
- [ ] All quality gates pass (see @CLAUDE.md for commands)
- [ ] No test failures introduced in areas of the code unrelated to this increment
